## üó®Ô∏è Explainable Information Retrieval
This research aims to make search systems more transparent by generating explanations that show why certain documents are relevant to a user's query.

**1) Generating Search Explanations using Large Language Models**<br />

> Aspect-oriented explanations in search results are typically concise text snippets placed alongside retrieved documents to serve as explanations that assist users in efficiently locating relevant information. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance for a range of problems, their potential to generate explanations for search results has not been explored. This study addresses that gap by leveraging both encoder-decoder and decoder-only LLMs to generate explanations for search results. The explanations generated are consistently more accurate and plausible explanations than those produced by a range of baseline models.

## üî• Social media sensing & Fire spread modelling
In this innovative project, we integrate social media sensing with fire spread modelling. We aim to enhance early fire detection and prediction by harnessing real-time data from social platforms. This interdisciplinary approach combines cutting-edge technology with environmental science, fostering a proactive strategy for wildfire management and community safety.
