## ðŸ’¬ Explainable Information Retrieval
This research aims to make search systems more transparent by generating explanations that show why certain documents are relevant to a user's query.

## ðŸ”¥ Social media sensing & Fire spread modelling
In this innovative project, we integrate social media sensing with fire spread modelling. We aim to enhance early fire detection and prediction by harnessing real-time data from social platforms. This interdisciplinary approach combines cutting-edge technology with environmental science, fostering a proactive strategy for wildfire management and community safety.
